            <h3>Directions</h3>
            <ul>
                    <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees</li>
                    <li>To make the Tangzhong, mix Tangzhong ingredients until no lumps</li>
                    <li>In a saucepan, continually stir until it becomes a thick, pudding like consistency</li>
                    <li>Transfer to a bowl and set aside to cool</li>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together dry ingredients</li>
                    <li>In another bowl, mix wet ingredients</li>
                    <li>Gradually, pour wet ingredients with dry ingredients while mixing</li>
                    <li>Add more flour little by little if the dough is too dry</li>
                    <li>If using a stand mixer or bread machine, let dough knead on medium for ~10 minutes until it is smooth and elastic</li>
                    <li>If kneading by hand, knead for ~10-20 minutes until smooth and elastic</li>
                    <li>Perform the window pane test* to check if the dough is well developed</li>
                    <li>Shape into a ball and place in lightly greased bowl</li>
                    <li>Cover bowl and place in a warm place until doubled for ~1-1.5 hours</li>
                    <li>After doubled, poke middle with a finger. If dough does not spring back, it is ready</li>
                    <li>Dump the dough on a floured surface and shape dough into balls.</li>
                    <li>Space them on a lined sheet and place in a warm place to rise until doubled. ~45 min.</li>
                    <li>Brush the surface of dough balls gently with the 2 tbsps of milk. Make sure to do it gently because you don't want to deflate the dough</li>
                    <li>Bake for 20-22 min until golden brown.</li>
                    <li>Let cool for 5 min. Serve immediately.</li>
